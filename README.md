# Portfolio Project
Description: This portfolio is based on a slider.  It uses HTML5 and CSS transitions for this affect.  It is composed of four slides.  Introduction, Technologies, Experience and Portfolio. More slides can be easily added.  

## Technologies
HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js and Heroku App Engine.

Optional: Ruby, Gem, Sass, Bourbon, Nodemon

## Running Locally
`node app.js`

or 

`npm install -g nodemon`

`nodemon app.js`

## Deploy to Heroku App Engine

`git push heroku master`

## This was originally created to be hosted on Google App Engine. But I ended up getting charged an arm and a leg for it.  So HELLO HEROKU!!!! (Though I should mention I prefer heroku. They're development and deployment process is cake.  I never once thought, I need to contact customer service.) Much love heroku. ;)
